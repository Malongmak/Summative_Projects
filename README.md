## Qn1: Dijkstra's/Bellman-Ford Algorithm for Weighted Graphs

### Goals:
- Implement Dijkstra’s algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph with positive weights.
- Implement the Bellman-Ford algorithm for graphs that may contain negative weights.

### Tasks:
- Create an adjacency list to represent a weighted graph.
- Implement Dijkstra’s algorithm to compute the shortest path from a source node.
- Enable user input for testing different graphs.
- Modify the implementation to handle negative weights using Bellman-Ford.

## Qn2: Huffman Coding for Image Compression

### Goals:
- Implement Huffman coding for compressing and decompressing text files.

### Tasks:
- Upload a file from local storage.
- Build a Huffman tree based on character frequency.
- Compress the file using Huffman coding and save the output.
- Implement a decompression function to reconstruct the original file.
- Compare the sizes of the original and compressed files.

## Qn3: Criminal Tracking Based on Contact

### Goals:
- Create a network graph to represent interpersonal connections and track a criminal's contacts.

### Tasks:
- Represent people and their connections as a graph.
- Allow the user to designate a source node (the criminal).
- Implement a Breadth-First Search (BFS) to trace contacts.
- Categorize contacts by proximity (direct, next-level, etc.).

## Qn4: Dictionary/Word Lookup System

### Goals:
- Build a dictionary application for efficient word definition searches.

### Tasks:
- Store words and definitions in a Binary Search Tree (BST).
- Implement add, delete, and search operations.
- Display all words in alphabetical order using in-order traversal.

---

## Qn5: Dynamic Student Records System

### Goals:
- Create a student records management system using Red-Black trees.

### Tasks:
- Store student information (ID, name, grades) in a Red-Black tree.
- Implement efficient functions for adding, deleting, and updating records.
- Allow searches by student ID.
- Display students in alphabetical order using in-order traversal.

---

## Qn6: To-Do List Manager

### Goals:
- Develop a task manager using a singly linked list.

### Tasks:
- Implement a singly linked list to store tasks (ID, description).
- Provide functionality to add, remove, and update tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed and remove them from the list.
